## üí° Usage

Simply click on the **Gua√≠ba Bridge Status** extension icon in your Chrome toolbar. A small popup will appear, displaying the latest information regarding the bridge's lifting schedule from the CCR ViaSul website.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The extension works by:

1.  Making an asynchronous request (using `fetch`) to the CCR ViaSul website (`https://rodovias.grupoccr.com.br/viasul/`).
2.  Parsing the returned HTML content using JavaScript's `DOMParser`.
3.  Searching for relevant information about the "Gua√≠ba Bridge" and its "lifting" status based on contextual keywords.
4.  Displaying the extracted text directly in the extension's popup.

**Note on Character Encoding:** The HTML file includes `<meta charset="utf-8">` to ensure all special characters are displayed correctly.

**Note on CORS:** The `host_permissions` in `manifest.json` are crucial for the extension to be able to fetch content directly from `rodovias.grupoccr.com.br` due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) security policies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **JavaScript:** For fetching data, parsing HTML, and dynamic content updates.
