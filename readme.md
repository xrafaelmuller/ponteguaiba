## üí° How to Use

Just click the **Gua√≠ba Bridge Status** extension icon in your Chrome toolbar. A small popup will appear, showing the latest information about the bridge's lifting schedules, directly from the CCR ViaSul website.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The extension operates as follows:

1.  It makes an asynchronous request (`fetch`) to the CCR ViaSul website (`https://rodovias.grupoccr.com.br/viasul/`).
2.  It parses the returned HTML content using JavaScript's `DOMParser`.
3.  It searches for schedules in the `(XXhXX)` format and organizes them chronologically.
4.  It checks the current time to determine if a lift is completed, is the next one up, or is scheduled for later.
5.  It activates a visual animation of the bridge if there are future lifts scheduled for the day.
6.  It displays the formatted schedules directly in the extension's popup.

**Host Permissions (`host_permissions`):** The permission in `manifest.json` is crucial for the extension to access content from the CCR ViaSul website, bypassing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) security policies.
